Summary•C++ is one of the oldest yet most popular programming languages in the world due to its performance and efficiency. 
•It’s often used in building performance-critical applications, video games (especially with Unreal Engine), servers, operating systems, etc 
 •To learn C++, you need to learn the syntax (grammar) of the language as well as C++ Standard Library, which is a collection of pre-written C++ code for solving common problems. 
 •To write C++ applications, we often use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The most popular IDEs are MS Visual Studio, XCode, and CLion.
 •To run C++ applications, first we have to compile our C++ code to machine code.•The main() function is the starting point of a C++ program.
